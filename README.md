# NYC-Accident-Data-Visualization
#Inspired by project https://stevebottos.github.io/jupnotes/LA%20Parking%20Violations%202018. 
I thought it would be more useful to make a similar version but with the vehicle collisions data in NYC instead.

The whole data set can be downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95. 

To see my code with rendered result, please visit:https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HangCcZ/NYC-Accident-Data-Visualization_2/blob/master/NYC_traffic.ipynb
My code can also be found in NYC_traffic.ipynb file in my repository.
